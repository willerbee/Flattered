# Flattered

üëã A VS Code extension that makes your editor look **flat, tidy, modern, and minimal**. This is not a theme, but a "theme overrider" or "theme flattener" so to speak. If you‚Äôve ever liked a color theme's look in the editor but wished for a cleaner, flatter overall look ‚Äî Flattered has you covered.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏é Ô∏èImportant Warnings ‚ö†Ô∏é

### 1. This extension touches your `workbench.colorCustomizations`
Flattered works by applying overrides to VS Code‚Äôs `workbench.colorCustomizations` setting.
- If you have custom tweaks or **commented-out properties** in this section of the settings, they may be lost.
- Please **back up your settings** before installing Flattered.

If you don‚Äôt mess with workbench.customizations, you‚Äôre safe to ignore this.

### 2. Themes may look "weird" with Flattered enabled
When Flattered is active, previewing out other themes might not look as expected because overrides are still applied.
To see a theme in its original form, use the **Reset Current Theme** command to remove overrides first. Unfortunately at the time of publish, there isn't a VS Code API event to automate this. Hopefully in the future.

## Features

- Apply a **flat and minimal style** on top of any theme.
- Works with your favorite color themes without replacing them.
- Toggle and reset easily from the command palette.

## Known Issues

- Manual user's overrides in `workbench.colorCustomizations` may get wiped out once overrides are applied.
- Some themes doesn't seem to be compatible with this, i.e. can find where their theme files are located (e.g. "Best Themes Redefined"). Still investigating why.

## For An Even More Minimal Look (bias)
- Hide the Activity Bar, much faster to use keyboard shortcuts
`"workbench.activityBar.location": "hidden"`
- Hide the Command Center, there's already the command pallete
`"window.commandCenter": false`
- Hide the Tab Bar, much faster to use ctrl+tab
`"workbench.editor.showTabs": "none"`
- Hide the Bread Crumbs, much faster to use cmd+o to go to identifiers
`"breadcrumbs.enabled": false`
- Show line numbers at intervals instead of each line, less distraction, ctrl+G to go to specific line
`"editor.lineNumbers": "interval"`
- Play around find fonts, ligatures and alt sets, and line heights, for better readability. My gotos are
  - LigaSrc Pro
  - Red Hat Mono *(I ligaturized one)*
  - Consolas
  - Cascadia
  - Jet Brains Mono
  - Fira Code
  - Ligconsolata
  - Anonymous Pro
  - `"editor.letterSpacing": -0.1`
  - `"editor.fontSize": 13`
  - `"editor.lineHeight": 1.8`
---

## Roadmap
- More commands
  - Change each of the Flattered setting


**I hope you enjoy a flatter VS Code!**
